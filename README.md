#### Install locales and important libraries

First of all, you need to install the following packages:

```bash
    sudo apt-get install libjson-perl liblocal-lib-perl liblocale-po-perl
```

Check which locales are supported on your machine:

```bash
    locale -a
```

Add locales you need (for example `ru_RU` or `ru_UA`):

```bash
    sudo locale-gen ru_RU
    sudo locale-gen ru_RU.UTF-8
    sudo locale-gen ru_UA.UTF-8
```

Update system locales:

```bash
    sudo update-locale
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

Install `poedit` on your machine:

```bash
    sudo apt-get install poedit
```
